## Ingredients

Here’s what I assembled to make about 4 quarts of beef bone broth:

- More broth
- 2 carrots, chopped medium
- 2 celery stalks, chopped medium
- 1 medium onion, chopped medium
- 7 garlic cloves, smashed
- 3.5 lb of beef bones (from US Wellness Meats or your local farmer)
- 2 bay leaves
- Kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
- water 

## Directions

Dump the vegetables in the bottom of a 6-quart slow cooker…
