## Ingredients

- 1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger tequila
- 3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
- ice cubes
- 1/2 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger grenadine syrup
- 1 slice orange, for garnish
- 1 maraschino cherry for garnish


## Directions

Stir or shake together tequila and orange juice. Fill a chilled 12 ounce glass with ice cubes; pour in orange juice mixture. Slowly pour in the grenadine, and allow it to settle to the bottom of the glass (be patient). Garnish with a slice of orange, and a maraschino cherry.
